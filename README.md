This is a Python program for a simple quiz game based on the popular Indian TV show "Kaun Banega Crorepati". The program starts by asking the player their name and welcoming them to the game. It then explains the rules of the game, which includes answering 5 questions with no lifelines and a wrong answer ending the game.

The questions and answer options are stored in separate lists. Each question is then printed along with its answer options. The player is prompted to enter their answer choice. If the player's choice matches the correct answer option, they win a certain amount of money, otherwise they lose the game.

The amount of money won or lost for each correct or incorrect answer is pre-defined in the program. At the end of the game, the player is given their final score based on the amount of money they won.

The program makes use of the Python input function to accept user input and the print function to display messages to the player. It also uses the Python breakpoint function to stop the program execution at certain points for debugging purposes.
